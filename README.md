# Topic-Modelling-LDA
Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic.
Here two implementations of the same are carried out with the help of two libraries, the first is Gensim and the second is sklearn. 
Different text cleaning techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, vectorization, tfidf, tokenization and detokenization are also used.
